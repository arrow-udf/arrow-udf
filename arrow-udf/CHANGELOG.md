## [0.5.1] - 2024-12-23

## [0.5.0] - 2024-10-10

### Fixed

### Changed

## [0.4.0] - 2024-09-19

### Fixed

- Fix deprecated warnings with `arrow` v52.
- Allow writer-style return value for `largestring`.
- deps: Pin all arrow version to 52 instead.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-04-25

### Added

- Add support for `int8`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `largestring`, and `largebinary` type.

### Breaking Changes

- The following types are renamed to align with Arrow:
    - `void` -> `null`
    - `int2` -> `int16`
    - `int4` -> `int32`
    - `int8` -> `int64`
    - `float4` -> `float32`
    - `float8` -> `float64`
    - `date` -> `date32`
    - `time` -> `time64`
    - `varchar` -> `string`
    - `bytea` -> `binary`

- `json` and `decimal` type are no longer mapped to `LargeString` and `LargeBinary` respectively. They are now mapped to [extension types](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#format-metadata-extension-types) with `String` as the storage type.
    - `json`: `ARROW:extension:name` = `arrorudf.json`
    - `decimal`: `ARROW:extension:name` = `arrowudf.decimal`

## [0.2.2] - 2024-04-02

### Changed

- Update `arrow` version to >=50.

### Fixed

- Fix compile error when returning struct type in table functions.

## [0.2.1] - 2024-02-29

### Added

- Re-export `chrono`, `rust_decimal` and `serde_json` in `types` module.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-02-29

### Added

- Add `StructType` trait and derive macro to define struct types.
- Support `->>` as an alias for `-> setof` in `#[function]`.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: The inline syntax `struct<..>` in function signatures is deprecated. Use `struct StructType` instead.

## [0.1.3] - 2024-02-18

### Fixed

- Fix the bug that the `#[function]` macro does not support more than 12 arguments.

## [0.1.2] - 2024-01-31

### Added

- Support type alias `numeric` and `jsonb` in `#[function]`.
- Support `varchar[]` and `bytea[]` as arguments.

## [0.1.1] - 2024-01-17

### Fixed

- Fixed returning a list in a struct. e.g. `-> struct<a:int[]>` is now supported.
- However, the trade-off is that the performance of returning a list might decrease.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-13

### Added

- Initial release. Support basic scalar functions and table functions.
